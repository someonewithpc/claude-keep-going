// that all had to be kept in sync by hand. Centralizing the JS-side copies here so
// there is exactly one definition to update.

// arms (timer runs have no $TMUX); processes inside a pane inherit $TMUX, whose first
// comma-field is exactly what tmux's #{socket_path} resolves to for that server.
