// ("✻ Brewed for …"), background-agent notices, and the "/usage-credits" hint. A live
// error/limit banner sits ABOVE this chrome, so when there's a lot of it — e.g. a tall
// task list — the banner is pushed well up the pane. A fixed last-N-lines tail then
// scrolls right past a genuine banner (observed: a session-limit banner ~16 lines up
// behind a task widget went undetected for ~54 min). Stripping trailing chrome first
// makes the tail measure distance-in-CONTENT, not raw lines — which also keeps the
// scrollback false-positive fixed (real work below a quoted banner is NOT chrome, so it
// isn't stripped and the stale banner stays out of the window).
//
// Each entry must be ANCHORED to how Claude Code actually renders the furniture — a
// full-line shape, leading indentation, or a footer position — not just "the line
// contains this glyph." The miss cost here is a false retry (stripping content lets a
// stale banner re-enter the window), so a loose glyph match (a bare "ctrl+", a stray
// arrow, any semver) is unacceptable. See Finding 2 in the PR review.

// --- Renders vs prose (#73) ---
// A pane line may MENTION a limit or a reset time without BEING one. `/try again in/i` is
// plain English, so "The API said to try again in 2 minutes before the window rolls" — or
// the user's own "it told me to try again in 2 minutes, is that right?" — is reset-shaped,
// and renders BELOW the banner it discusses, where a bottom-up scan finds it first.
//
// The discriminator is the SHAPE of the line, not its vocabulary, and it is stated as a
// VETO: a reset-shaped line is eligible unless something marks it as conversation. Stated
// the other way round — an allowlist of known banner shapes — every render this file does
// not recognise is demoted, including a LIVE one sitting below a stale banner, which is
// worse than the pre-#73 behavior it replaces ("Claude usage limit reached. Resets at 2pm"
// below "… resets 11:30am" would hand the monitor the stale time, and #70's latch would
// then mark it non-correctable).
//
// "A veto only demotes what it can positively identify, so an unrecognised render keeps the
// freshness ordering it had before" is the property this is FOR — but being a veto does not
// establish it, and stating it that way concealed three violations for three revisions. A
// signal that fires on a real render demotes it whichever direction the rule is phrased in.
// What actually holds the property is the ordering below: everything except the prompt glyph
// is subordinate to whether the line names a limit.
//
// Four per-line signals, no neighbour lookups:
//
//   0. NAMING A LIMIT. Checked FIRST (after the prompt glyph) and rescues the line outright:
//      signals 2-4 are evidence of prose, and prose is all they may veto. This is what the
//      first three revisions got wrong — each demoted a render that plainly named a limit.
//   1. THE PROMPT GLYPH. ❯/> introduce the user's own input, which is never a render — the
//      one signal that outranks naming a limit, since the user typing about their own limit
//      is the #73 report's second half.
//   2. SENTENCE PUNCTUATION. A render does not end in ./?/! — "· resets 3pm (UTC)" — while
//      a sentence does, including one whose WRAPPED continuation happens to begin with the
//      clause ("  try again in 2 minutes, so I'll wait."). tmux capture-pane is called
//      without -J (src/tmux.js), so a wrap arrives as its own line: a rule keyed on what
//      LEADS the line would read that continuation as a render.
//   3. WHAT FOLLOWS THE RESET CLAUSE. A render stops at the time, give or take a timezone
//      qualifier or the rest of a compound duration ("· resets 3pm (UTC)", "resets 3am NY",
//      "resets in 3 hours 15 minutes"). A sentence keeps going: "…resets 9am tomorrow
//      according to the header".
//
// WHY THE SIGNALS ARE ORDERED THE WAY THEY ARE — the two errors do not cost the same.
// Returning prose parses a SHORT wait: the monitor wakes early, finds the limit still
// live, and re-derives. Returning a stale banner parses a LONG one — and because a stale
// line parses, `_waitIsFallback` is false (monitor.js:111) and only fallbacks are
// correctable (:139), so #70's latch refuses to revisit it. Under-waiting self-corrects;
// over-waiting is unrecoverable until the wait expires. Every signal below therefore only
// ever fires where the line is unambiguously conversation, and a line that NAMES a limit
// is treated as a render — the prompt glyph excepted, since the user's own input row is
// never a render whatever it says.
//
// This is the correction to the first three cuts of this fix, all of which stated the
// invariant as "a veto only demotes what it can positively identify" and then broke it
// three ways: SENTENCE_END demoted every period-terminated render ("Rate limit exceeded.
// Please try again in 5 hours."), the tail budget demoted every render with an inline hint
// ("· resets 5:20pm · /upgrade to increase your limits"), and the bullet veto demoted the
// API-error render whose vocabulary is underscored. Each one identified a RENDER and
// demoted it. Making "names a limit" a uniform rescue is what actually holds the invariant.
//
// The message bullets are NOT a signal on their own: #63's fixture has a live banner
// rendering as "● You've hit your session limit · resets 2:10am". They mark a line only
// when nothing else on it says "render" — i.e. the bullet introduces a sentence ABOUT a

// The spend-limit banner (#71) is the one render allowed to skip the reset-time anchor:
// "You've hit your org's monthly spend limit · run /usage-credits …" carries NO reset,
// yet both reporters confirmed the underlying 5h block resets and waiting works. With no
// reset line to anchor on, the shape itself carries the false-positive defense: both real
// renders START the line with "You've hit …" (optionally behind an echo marker), while
// prose explaining spend limits references them mid-sentence ("when you hit your monthly
// spend limit …"). The remaining anchors are the /usage-credits companion in the live
// region, and the wait produced downstream being the bounded, correctable fallback.
//
// Four things the shape has to tolerate, none of which it did — and each a TOTAL miss,
// not a weaker match, because a banner naming /usage-credits inline that fails this pattern
// is also the banner nothing else in the file recognises:
//   - THE MARKER VARIES. ⚠ and · prefix limit renders elsewhere in this file (see the TUI
//     sketch above); admitting only ⎿/└ made "⚠ You've hit your org's monthly spend limit …"
//     invisible.
//   - ⚠ ALSO ARRIVES IN EMOJI PRESENTATION. "⚠️" is U+26A0 + U+FE0F, and the variation
//     selector is neither whitespace nor part of the phrase, so it failed the whole pattern.
//   - THE BANNER CAN BE BOXED. "│ ⚠ You've hit your limit │" is the render this suite
//     already pins for SESSION banners; those survive on the unanchored LIMIT+RESET pair,
//     but the spend banner has no reset line, so this pattern is its only path in.
//   - APOSTROPHES ARE TYPOGRAPHIC. The qualifier class already admits ’ for "org’s"; the
//     "you've" ahead of it did not, so a render in curly quotes was missed as well. The
//     apostrophe itself is REQUIRED though — every real render prints one, and without it
//     "youve hit your monthly spend limit" walks the one path into a wait that needs no
//     reset time to corroborate it.
//
// And one it has to EXCLUDE: `^\s*` is not an anchor. Model output wraps with a hanging
// indent, so a continuation line begins with whitespace and then whatever the sentence was
// up to — quoting the banner ("⏺ The team banner reads:" / "  You've hit your org's monthly
// spend limit · …") false-fired a 5h wait and then typed retries into an idle session. A
// render starts at column 0, behind a box border, or behind an echo marker; indented with
// none of those is a wrap. (A quotation that lands at column 0 still fires; the remaining
// anchors are the live-region gate and the bounded, correctable fallback the wait lands on.)
// Trailing punctuation is deliberately NOT a signal: "You've hit your monthly spend limit."
// — the individual variant from the #71 report — is a real render with a full stop.
//
// WHICH PREFIX MAY BE INDENTED IS THEREFORE PART OF THE SHAPE, and the classes differ:
//   - ⎿/└ are TOOL-ECHO markers. They render as indented children of the notice above them
//     ("● Agent \"…\" finished" / "  ⎿ You've hit …"), so they must be allowed leading space.
//     Neither is a character prose reaches for, so that costs nothing.
//   - │ is a BOX BORDER, and a box is indented or not as a whole — it carries its own
//     column-0 evidence, so leading space costs nothing there either.
//   - ⚠/· are BARE BANNER markers, and outside a box the TUI prints them flush left.
//     Indented, they are prose BULLETS: a model quoting the banner bullets it far more often
//     than it hangs it under a bare indent, so admitting them there reopens the very wrap
//     hole the paragraph above closes.
// (● / ⏺ stay out entirely: the assistant-message glyph, so "⏺ You've hit …" is likelier a
// model quoting the banner than a render — the most dangerous prefix that could be added,
// with no reset time to check it against. A leading • stays out for the mirror-image reason:
// no render uses it, and it is purely a prose bullet.)

// of the window Claude Code prints this and injects a checkpoint instruction; the model
// finishes the step, lists what's left and ends the turn at an idle prompt with NO limit
// banner. Unlike every other render this file matches, the notice is NOT the last content
// line — the model's wrap-up output follows it — so the window is wider than the banner
// tail, and "still live" is decided by what sits BELOW the notice rather than by where it
// sits: a user row (❯/> plus text) below it means the turn it introduced has already been
// answered — by the user, or by our own nudge, which renders exactly that way. Bottom-up,
// the first user row met above any notice ends the search. That row is the dedup.
//
// Shape-anchored like the #77 render head: the notice BEGINS its line, behind at most a
// message glyph — a glyphed head may be indented (the TUI indents blocks), a bare head must
// start at column 0 — so prose quoting it mid-line and a user-typed copy never match.
