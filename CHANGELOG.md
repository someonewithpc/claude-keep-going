# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`compact.minContextTokens`** sets the policy trigger's threshold in tokens (the
  current prompt size from the statusline), alongside or instead of `minContextPercent`.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-10-03

### Added
- **The badge shows when idle compaction is armed:** `🟢KG 🗜` while its window is open,
  `🟢KG 🗜22:00` before the window opens, and the countdown once one is scheduled.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed
- **`migrate --quiet` no longer logs on every reconcile run** while monitors from an older
  install keep `~/.claude-auto-retry` alive. It used to print "kept ..." every 5 minutes
  into the reconcile service's journal.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added
- **Weekly-limit model fallback** (`modelFallback`, off by default). On a limit scoped to
  one model ("You've hit your Opus limit"), the monitor sends `/model <fallback>` from
  `modelFallback.map` and continues, then switches back at an idle prompt once that limit
  resets. Account-wide limits still wait.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added
- **Reset time from the statusline.** A usage wait with no reset time on screen (it fell
  back to `fallbackWaitHours`) now takes the reset of the full usage window from the
  statusline tap, even when that is later, as with a full weekly window.
- **Claude Code's own auto-continue goes first** (`native.usageLimit`, default `defer`).
  With the hooks installed, the first continue after a reset waits `native.graceSeconds`
  (180) for Claude Code to resume the session itself, sends at once if it reports giving
  up, and logs `native-missed` when it had to step in.
- **Network check before the continue** (`networkCheck`). After a wait the monitor checks
  that the API host (or the HTTPS proxy) accepts a connection before sending, holding for
  up to 10 minutes, so a resume from suspend doesn't waste an attempt.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added
- **Idle compaction (`compact` config block, off by default).** The monitor sends
  `/compact` once a session's turn has ended, nothing is running in the background, no
  wakeup is scheduled and no permission prompt is open. It fires a minute before the
  prompt cache expires (from the statusline tap), or a fixed number of minutes after the
  turn. Triggers: the session asked with `claude-keep-going request compact [focus]`, the
  context passed `minContextPercent`, or (opt-in) the last message mentions `/compact`.
  Optional gates: a local time window and no tmux input for `awayMinutes`. It skips when
  the cache is already cold, never types into a non-empty input box, and confirms the
  result through the `PostCompact` hook.
- **The badge counts down to a scheduled compaction** (`🟢KG 🗜3m`), in both
  `tmux-status.sh` and `status --pane`.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added
- **Hooks for turn state.** `install-hook` now also registers `Stop`, `UserPromptSubmit`,
  `Notification`, `PostCompact` and `PostModelSwitch` hooks. Each writes a small marker for
  the pane (whether the turn ended, what is still running in the background, open
  permission prompts, compactions, model switches). Nothing reads them yet; idle
  compaction in the next release does. The hooks run async and print nothing. They fall
  back to `$TMUX_PANE`, so sessions adopted by `reconcile` produce markers too.
- **`claude-keep-going statusline-tap -- <cmd>`** wraps your statusLine command, saves the
  prompt-cache expiry, usage-window resets, context usage and model for the pane, and
  runs `<cmd>` with the same input.
- **`install-hook --dump`** records raw hook payloads to
  `~/.local/state/claude-keep-going/hook-dump.jsonl`, for checking what a Claude Code
  version sends. `uninstall-hook --dump` removes only that.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-10-03

### Changed
- **Files live in XDG base directories.** Config is `~/.config/claude-keep-going/config.json`
  (layered over `/etc/xdg/claude-keep-going/config.json`), logs are under
  `~/.local/state/claude-keep-going/logs/`, and status files, StopFailure markers, the
  reconcile lock and exclude list and env snapshots are under
  `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/claude-keep-going/` with mode 0700. Without `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` the
  runtime files go to `$TMPDIR/claude-keep-going-<uid>/`, which is refused unless you own it.

### Added
- **`claude-keep-going migrate`** moves the config and logs from `~/.claude-auto-retry*`,
  copying and comparing each file before removing the original, and deletes the rest of
  the old directory once no older monitor uses it. `install` offers it (`--yes`,
  `--no-migrate`), and `reconcile` deletes the leftover directory later. The Nix modules
  run `migrate --yes` themselves.
- **`claude-keep-going status --pane <id>`** prints the status badge for one pane, the same
  output as `tmux-status.sh`. A Claude Code statusLine command can call it instead of
  reading the status file itself, so it doesn't have to know where the file lives.
- **Nix `settings` option.** `programs.claude-keep-going.settings` is written as the JSON
  config: `/etc/xdg/claude-keep-going/config.json` from the NixOS module,
  `~/.config/claude-keep-going/config.json` from home-manager.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-10-03

### Added
- **The auto-created tmux session can be named.** It was hardcoded to
  `claude-keep-going-<pid>-<timestamp>`: unique, but opaque — `tmux ls` after a few launches is
  a wall of timestamps and nothing says which checkout each session belongs to, so
  re-attaching to a specific run meant guessing. `claude --tmux-session api` names one
  launch and `CLAUDE_KEEP_GOING_SESSION_NAME` names every launch from a shell; the flag
  wins over the env var and is consumed by the launcher, so it never reaches `claude`
  (which would reject it as an unknown option). Unnamed launches are unchanged. `.` and
  `:` are normalized to `_` up front because tmux rewrites its own target separators as it
  creates the session — without that the name we hold would stop matching the session tmux
  made, and the follow-up `-t` targets would miss. A name already in use fails with the
  `tmux attach` command for the existing session rather than a raw tmux error, and attach
  now uses an exact-name target (`-t '=api'`) so a name that is a prefix of another
  session's no longer resolves to the wrong one.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed
- **Event-driven usage-limit detection.** A `rate_limit` StopFailure marker is now
  consumed by the monitor: if the live pane scrape at marker time already caught the
  banner, nothing changes; otherwise it falls back to the reset-time message in the
  session's transcript — resolved via the marker's `transcript_path` (the standard hook
  envelope field), with `cwd`/`session_id` reconstruction only as a fallback for older
  Claude Code builds — and enters the existing hours-scale usage-wait. Previously
  `rate_limit` markers were written and immediately discarded, leaving detection entirely
  dependent on the scraper's tail window — a race that could strand a session with no
  interactive limit banner for hours (#50). Follow-ups from review: (1) the wait now
  tracks that it came from a transcript-resolved marker (`viaUsageEvent`) and, while that's
  set, an absent banner in the tail is no longer read as "resolved" — previously the retry
  at expiry was skipped entirely (`!isRateLimited` short-circuited straight to
  user-continued), and stale working-shaped scrollback (an unrelated old deploy log) could
  tear the wait down mid-countdown; (2) an unresolved marker is no longer consumed before a
  transcript record has had a chance to flush — it's left in place for a later tick,
  bounded by the marker's own staleness window rather than cleared on the first miss;
  (3) `transcript_path` is now actually persisted onto the marker — it was being written to
  the pane-keyed event file, dropping the very field the cwd-vs-launch-dir fix depends on,
  so that fallback was dead code in production until now; (4) the "couldn't resolve a reset
  time" warning is latched to once per marker instead of once per poll tick, so a marker
  that stays unresolved for its whole staleness window no longer produces dozens of
  identical log lines.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-10-03

### Changed
- **Renamed to claude-keep-going.** This fork of claude-auto-retry has a new package name,
  binary, Nix option (`programs.claude-keep-going`), systemd and launchd unit names, and
  environment variables (`CLAUDE_KEEP_GOING_*`). The status badge reads `KG` instead of `AR`.
  State files stay under `~/.claude-auto-retry*` for now, so running monitors keep working.
- **`install` and `install-timer` replace what claude-auto-retry installed.** `install`
  removes the old `# >>> claude-auto-retry >>>` block from your rc files, so there is only
  one `claude()` function. `install-timer` disables and deletes the old reconcile timer or
  LaunchAgent. `install-hook` already replaced the old StopFailure entry, since both
  packages mark it with the same subcommand name.

### Fixed
- **The StopFailure hook no longer needs `node` on Claude Code's PATH.** The hook command
  was `node <path>/cli.js`, which fails silently when Claude Code runs it with a PATH that
  has no `node`. It now names the node binary by absolute path, or the Nix wrapper
  (which also brings tmux and procps) when installed from the flake. Re-run `install-hook`
  to pick it up; the Nix modules do this on their own.
- **A weekly-limit banner with a calendar date is now detected and parsed.** Weekly limits
  render their reset with a date — "You've hit your weekly limit · resets Aug 21 at 3pm
  (Australia/Brisbane)", a real Claude Code record surfaced by PR #56's fixture — and both
  the reset detector and the parser only knew clock-only forms ("resets 3pm", "resets at
  3:00 PM", "resets in 3 hours"), which require a digit right after "resets". The scraper
  therefore saw no reset line next to the limit and never detected the banner at all, and
  a message reaching the parser by another route fell to the 5-hour fallback — after which
  the monitor woke into a limit with days left on it and burned its retries. The dated form
  is now a reset clause (ending at the time, so the run-on veto measures the same tail as
  the clock-only form), and the wait anchors to that calendar day in the banner's timezone:
  no today/tomorrow roll, year inferred across a December→January boundary, and a dated
  reset already in the past means the limit cleared — retry now rather than a year later.

### Added
- **A session Claude Code winds down near the 5-hour limit is nudged back to work (#78).**
  At ~95% of the window Claude Code injects a checkpoint instruction into the model's
  context and prints "⏺ Approaching your 5-hour usage limit — Claude will wrap up the
  current step." The model finishes the step, lists what's left and ends the turn: no
  limit banner, an idle prompt, nothing to resume it — an overnight run parked at 95% until
  long after the window reset. It is a feature-flagged Claude Code behavior with no
  user-facing switch, so the render is handled instead: at the idle prompt the monitor
  sends one `continue`, and the session either finishes or reaches the real limit, where
  the usage wait takes over. Not another bounded-retry machine — the nudge renders as a
  user row under the notice, and a notice with a user row below it (the user's or ours)
  has already been answered, so it is never nudged twice; `maxRetries` only bounds the
  case where the nudge never renders. Shape-anchored like the interrupted-stream head:
  the notice begins its line behind at most a message glyph, so a quotation or a typed
  copy cannot trigger it. Configured under `nearLimitWrapUp`; `"enabled": false` keeps
  the checkpoint stop.
- **A turn truncated by a suspended machine or a dropped connection is now resumed.**
  Claude Code wraps the response body in a byte watchdog; when the bytes stop arriving it
  aborts the stream and finalizes whatever had already been printed, naming the cause on an
  `API Error:` line ("Your computer went to sleep mid-response. The response above may be
  incomplete."). The turn is then over — the prompt returns idle and nothing resumes it, so
  a session can sit on a half-finished answer indefinitely. Claude Code retries by itself
  only while the response is still thinking-only; once real content has been yielded it
  declines to retry, which is precisely when this render appears. Seeing it at an idle
  prompt, the monitor now sends `continue`, bounded at `maxRetries` because a machine that
  just woke may not have its network back yet. All seven renders the finalizer emits are
  matched (suspend, dropped connection, stalled stream and mid-response server error, in
  both their "mid-response" and "before a response was produced" forms) — they leave the
  same wreckage and take the same remedy. Detection is anchored on the SHAPE of the line
  rather than its vocabulary: a real render *begins* with `API Error:`, behind at most
  Claude's message glyph, so a session merely explaining the error — which quotes the whole
  render, anchor included, mid-sentence — cannot trigger a resume. The glyph and the
  indentation are one rule: a glyphed head may sit anywhere, a bare head must start at
  column 0, because an indented glyph-less head is the hanging-indent shape of a quotation
  rather than a render. Configured under a `streamInterrupted` block.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed
- **A live banner is no longer outranked by reset-shaped prose below it (#73).** The
  reset-message scan returned the lowest reset-shaped line in the pane, and `try again in
  …` matches ordinary English — so a model sentence ("The API said to try again in 2
  minutes …") or the user's own question, rendered *below* the banner it discusses, stole
  the parse and turned a 5-hour wait into ~3 minutes. The monitor then woke into the
  still-live limit and burned `maxRetries` before the real reset. The discriminator is the
  shape of the line, not its vocabulary, and it is stated as a *veto*: a reset-shaped line
  stays eligible unless something marks it as conversation — the user's input row (`❯`/`>`),
  sentence punctuation, a run-on past the reset clause ("…resets 9am tomorrow according to
  the header"), or a message bullet introducing something other than a limit or reset
  clause. The last two are what catch prose whose *wrapped* continuation happens to begin
  with the clause. Eligibility is decided per line and never by inspecting a neighbour, so
  the bottom-up scan — and therefore freshness — is unchanged, and anything vetoed falls
  through to the previous behaviour rather than to no match at all.

  Every signal except the prompt glyph is subordinate to whether the line **names a limit**:
  a line that does is treated as a render however it is punctuated, glyphed or trailed. That
  ordering is the correction to this change's own first three revisions, each of which
  claimed the veto "only demotes what it can positively identify" and then demoted real
  renders three ways — period-terminated banners ("Rate limit exceeded. Please try again in
  5 hours."), banners with an inline hint ("· resets 5:20pm · /upgrade to increase your
  limits"), and the API-error render whose vocabulary is underscored (`rate_limit_error`).
  The two errors do not cost the same: returning prose parses a *short* wait, which is a
  fallback and so gets revisited (#70), while returning a stale banner parses a *long* one
  that latches non-correctable. Doubt therefore resolves toward the fresher line.

  **Known boundary:** prose that names a limit *itself* — "⏺ You've hit your usage limit, so
  try again in 2 minutes." — is per-line indistinguishable from a render and still outranks
  the banner. This is unchanged from previous behaviour rather than introduced here, and it
  is the recoverable direction of the two. Also unchanged: an unglyphed, unpunctuated
  continuation that begins with the clause and ends within two words (`│  try again in 20
  minutes  │`), which cannot be separated from a wrapped banner line (`  resets 8:40pm
  (Europe/London)`) without dropping the only line carrying the time.
- **The reconcile lock could double-hold under contention (the flaky cross-process suite
  test was a real race, not a bad test).** After winning the breaker, the stale-lock removal
  was an *unconditional* `unlink` — even when the re-read under the breaker found the lock
  already **absent** (its holder released and exited between the staleness verdict and the
  break). The fast path is deliberately not serialized by the breaker, so an acquirer could
  create a fresh live lock in that read→unlink gap; the unlink then deleted it and the
  breaker-holder created a second lock — two reconcile runs proceeding at once, each arming
  monitors. Reproduced at ~0.2% of contended rounds on a single loaded core (2 overlapping
  holds in 823, then 1 in 1,072, with the acquisition-path event log pinning the interleave);
  the stale removal is now identity-checked and skipped entirely when the lock was absent —
  0 overlaps in 6,205 holds under the same load afterwards. Thanks @nyxaria for flagging the
  flake.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed
- **A banner that names `/usage-credits` inline is no longer treated as UI furniture.** The
  chrome allowlist matched the hint anywhere on a line, but the companion row is not the
  only place it renders — a session banner can carry it inline ("You've hit your session
  limit · resets 5:20pm · run /usage-credits to finish"), and the spend-limit banner always
  does. Those lines were stripped as chrome, so the tail dropped the only line naming the
  limit: the spend banner needed a special case to be seen at all, and a session banner's
  reset time was invisible to the parse, sending the monitor to the `fallbackWaitHours`
  default instead of the real reset. The entry is now anchored to the hint *leading* its
  row, which covers every banner that mentions it — and removes both the special case and
  its forward reference to a constant declared 100 lines below.
- **Spend-limit render shapes that were total misses (#71 follow-up).** The banner pattern
  admitted only the `⎿`/`└` echo markers, so the `⚠`- and `·`-prefixed renders — markers
  this file already expects on limit banners — were never matched; the `⚠` in emoji
  presentation (`⚠️`, U+26A0 + U+FE0F) failed on the variation selector; the **boxed** form
  (`│ ⚠ You've hit … │`, the render this suite already pins for session banners) was not
  admitted at all, and unlike a session banner the spend render has no reset line to fall
  back on; and the pattern required an ASCII apostrophe in "you've" while the qualifier
  beside it already admitted `’`, so a render in typographic quotes was missed too. All of
  them compounded with the chrome misclassification above: invisible rather than merely
  unanchored. The apostrophe is now *required* in the other direction — "youve hit your
  monthly spend limit" no longer walks the one detection path that needs no reset time.
- **A wrapped or bulleted quotation of the spend banner no longer false-fires a wait.**
  `^\s*` is not an anchor when model output wraps with a hanging indent: a continuation line
  beginning "You've hit your org's monthly spend limit …" entered a 5-hour wait and typed
  retries into an idle session. A render starts at column 0, behind a box border, behind a
  flush-left `⚠`/`·` banner marker, or behind a `⎿`/`└` tool-echo marker (the only ones that
  legitimately render indented, as children of the notice above them). An indented `⚠`/`·`/`•`
  is a prose bullet — the shape a model quoting the banner actually produces — and no longer
  counts as a render. (Trailing punctuation deliberately stays out of it — "You've hit your
  monthly spend limit." is a real render with a full stop.) The column-0 rule is a rendering
  assumption, so it has one escape hatch: when the **standalone** `/usage-credits` companion
  row renders below the banner — evidence a quotation essentially never carries, since it
  reproduces the banner line and not the separate row beneath it — the indented form is
  accepted, keeping a real render printed one space too far right, or wrapped.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- **The org/monthly spend-limit banner is now detected (#71).** Team/org accounts (and
  individual accounts whose extra-usage budget is exhausted) get "You've hit your org's
  monthly spend limit · run /usage-credits …" — undetected for two independent reasons:
  the render carries no reset time (and detection deliberately anchors on one), and the
  `org's` possessive defeated the limit-pattern shape. Both reporters confirmed the
  underlying 5-hour block resets and waiting works, so the banner now routes into the
  usage wait as a limit with unknown reset: the bounded `fallbackWaitHours` default,
  latched correctable — if a real "resets <time>" banner appears mid-wait, the wake-up
  shortens to the true instant, and genuine budget exhaustion ends in the normal
  max-retries give-up. With no reset line to anchor on, the false-positive defense moves
  into the shape: only the banner phrasing (line starts "You've hit …"), only next to its
  `/usage-credits` companion, and only in the live region — prose *explaining* spend
  limits, and stale banners with real work below, stay inert. The banner also had to be
  exempted from chrome classification: it carries "/usage-credits" inline, so the
  companion furniture rule would otherwise classify the banner itself as chrome and hide
  it from the reset-message scan.
- **A fallback wait is now corrected once the real reset time appears on screen.** The
  `/rate-limit-options` menu does not always render a reset line, so confirming "Stop and
  wait" could commit the `fallbackWaitHours` default (5h) — and the waiting branch returned
  early on every tick and never looked at the pane again, so the banner Claude Code prints
  immediately after confirming, which *does* carry the time, was ignored for the whole
  fallback. Observed live: a session whose limit reset at 18:20 sat parked until 22:27 with
  `attempts: 0`, ~4 idle hours, while the banner naming 18:20 was on screen the entire time.
  A wait derived from an unreadable screen is now latched as a fallback and re-derived from
  the live banner each tick until a real reset time is found; waits that already came from a
  real reset time are never re-parsed. Confirming the menu starts a fresh retry episode, so
  the correction still applies when the menu re-renders after a retry has been sent.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-13

### Security
- **Secrets no longer ride any tmux argv (#68).** The environment used to cross into the
  auto-created session as `new-session -e KEY=VALUE` pairs (and, below tmux 3.2, as
  inline `export`s in the pane command) — and when that invocation is the one that
  starts the tmux server, the server keeps the whole argv in `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`,
  world-readable, for its entire multi-day lifetime. API keys, tokens and connection
  strings were retrievable with a plain `ps`. The environment now crosses via a `0600`
  JSON snapshot in a `0700` dir (`~/.claude-auto-retry/tmp/`); only the file *path*
  appears on the command line, and the inner launcher loads it into `process.env` and
  unlinks it (with a 24h sweep for launches that died before consuming). Loading in
  Node rather than `source` round-trips names a POSIX shell can't — `BASH_FUNC_name%%`
  exported functions, Windows `ProgramFiles(x86)` — which also retires the entire
  "tmux rejects this env name" launch-failure class (#58) and the lenient/strict retry
  machinery with it. Environment fidelity is *higher* than before: names the argv
  filter had to drop now cross intact.

### Changed
- **Clean exits reap their tmux session (#69).** The pane tail was an unconditional
  `; exec $SHELL`, so no session was ever destroyed — a clean `/exit` left an idle
  login shell pinning the session and its whole process tree forever (measured by the
  reporter: 66 sessions holding 16.4 GB after 3 days). The shell fallback is now
  reserved for **non-zero** launcher exits, where the crash scrollback is genuinely
  useful; on a clean exit the pane command ends and tmux reaps the session itself.
  `CLAUDE_KEEP_GOING_KEEP_SHELL=1` restores the old behavior.
- **`CLAUDE_KEEP_GOING_NO_TMUX=1`** skips tmux session creation entirely, for users
  already inside a non-tmux multiplexer (Zellij, screen) who don't want a nested
  session per launch (#69). Explicit opt-out — the nested session is what the monitor
  drives, so this disables auto-retry for the run, and that trade belongs to the user.
- The pane command now invokes the launching Node binary by absolute path instead of
  relying on `node` being resolvable through a possibly-stale tmux server `PATH`.

### Fixed
- **Launch no longer fails with `server exited unexpectedly` when it races a
  dying tmux server (#69 follow-up).** Session reaping means the tmux server now
  exits once the last claude session ends (`exit-empty` defaults on) — and a
  `new-session` landing in the teardown window (socket still on disk, server
  draining) connects, sees EOF mid-handshake, and aborted the whole launch. This
  window could not exist before reaping, because the server never exited.
  Session creation now retries up to twice (250 ms apart) when the failure is
  `server exited unexpectedly` / `lost server`; the next attempt finds the
  socket gone or stale and cold-starts a fresh server. Real failures (duplicate
  session, tmux missing, bad option) still fail immediately. Reproduced and
  verified against real tmux 3.4: 23 forced race hits, 23 recovered, 0 residual
  failures across 250 timed attempts.
- **A usage-meter statusline no longer hijacks the reset-time parse (#61).** ccusage-style
  statuslines render a permanent countdown row at the very bottom of the pane
  ("current ●●●●●●●●●● 100%  ⟳ resets in 1 hr 47 min"). That row matches the reset
  patterns and sits below any live banner, so the bottom-up scan in
  `findRateLimitMessage` returned it instead of the banner — and its wording isn't
  parseable, so a banner with a perfectly good "resets 6:20am (Europe/Brussels)" fell
  back to the 5-hour default wait. Meter rows (countdown glyph variants, dotted gauges
  with a percentage, the cost row) are now classified as chrome, and
  `findRateLimitMessage` skips chrome the same way the detectors already do. This also
  removes a standing false-positive anchor: the meter's "resets" line no longer
  validates limit-shaped prose near the bottom of the pane.
- **A failed env-snapshot write now warns instead of degrading silently** (PR #72
  review follow-up). If `~/.claude-auto-retry/tmp` is unwritable (read-only or
  over-quota `$HOME` — NFS-mounted HPC homes especially), the launch still proceeds,
  but the pane runs with the tmux **server's** startup environment: on a pre-existing
  server that can be days stale, so a rotated `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or fresh proxy var
  quietly never reached `claude` with zero diagnostic. The degrade stays; the silence
  goes — a stderr warning now names the cause.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- **Adversarial review of this release's own fixes caught and closed seven follow-ups:**
  the stdin buffer now mirrors claude's 3-second no-data grace instead of hanging on a
  held-open pipe (`ssh` without `-n`, CI harnesses); DST-transition wall times that
  don't exist (spring-forward) or repeat (fall-back) resolve deterministically to the
  late side on every host; the overload recovery reset no longer counts Claude's own
  in-flight `Retrying in …` render as recovery (escalation and the give-up cap survive
  sustained outages) and no longer drops the same-banner memo (no scraper re-fire into
  a recovered session); exported bash functions (`BASH_FUNC_name%%`) are forwarded
  again, with a strict-POSIX retry if a tmux build rejects them; the tmux < 3.2 inline
  branch no longer clobbers the pane's TERM; socket paths with consecutive spaces
  survive `parsePanes` verbatim.
- **StopFailure markers are socket-keyed** (like status files): with two tmux servers,
  a marker for one server's `%2` could be consumed by the monitor watching the other
  server's `%2`. Readers fall back to the legacy filename so an older installed hook's
  markers aren't dropped mid-upgrade.
- **`claude` now launches on tmux 3.0–3.1c (Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 11).** `new-session -e`
  only exists from tmux 3.2; gating it at 3.0 made session creation fail outright with
  `unknown option -- e` on those distros. Below 3.2 the critical env vars are exported
  inline in the command instead.
- **A tool result taller than the detection window can no longer revive the #63 false
  positive.** The tool-echo mask is now computed over the full pane and sliced to the
  window, so quoted banner/error lines stay masked even when their `● Name(` header sits
  above the window. Applies to the limit, overload, and safeguard matchers.
- **DST-safe roll-to-tomorrow.** A stale reset time was rolled forward by a flat 24h of
  milliseconds — one hour short across a fall-back night (the monitor woke early with the
  banner still live, burned its retries, and gave up before the real reset) and one hour
  long across spring-forward. Tomorrow's occurrence is now computed on the actual
  calendar day.
- **A stale `Retrying in …` / `attempt N/M` transcript line no longer suppresses the
  retry forever.** The waiting branch treated any working-pattern match as "user
  continued", churning without ever sending. Resumed now means working signal rendered
  *below* the last banner line; work above it is history.
- **Event-path overload incidents close on recovery.** Backoff counters leaked across
  fully-recovered incidents (escalating 30s → 300s waits for unrelated failures days
  apart) until the total-wait cap silently disabled the hook path for the session.
  Counters reset when the pane is seen working again or when a fresh marker arrives well
  after the last retry.
- **Print-mode retries keep a piped prompt.** `cat doc.md | claude -p` had its stdin
  consumed by the first attempt; retries ran with an empty prompt. Piped stdin is now
  buffered once and re-fed to every attempt.
- **The shell wrapper no longer wipes user INT/TERM traps in zsh** (macOS default
  shell). `trap -p` is a bashism; zsh now uses native `localtraps` scoping.
- **Timer-armed monitors show up in the tmux status bar.** They wrote status files under
  a `default` socket key the `#{socket_path}`-driven reader never looks up; reconcile now
  passes the real socket path through.
- **A monitor on another tmux server's pane no longer masks this server's same-numbered
  pane in `reconcile`** (pane ids are only unique per server).
- **tmux session creation no longer fails on Windows (Git Bash / MSYS2) environments.**
  `tmux new-session -e` rejects non-POSIX variable names that Windows shells always
  carry (`ProgramFiles(x86)`, `=C:` drive pseudo-vars, `!ExitCode`) with
  `invalid environment variable name`, which aborted the whole launch. Environment
  forwarding now filters names to POSIX `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`; everything else is
  passed through unchanged (#58).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- **Quoted banner text in a tool-call render no longer triggers a bogus wait.** A pane
  line like `● Bash(grep "5-hour limit reached - resets 3pm" …)` — or quoted log lines
  in its result block — matched the limit patterns and parked the monitor for the
  parsed hours (a real 22.5h incident). Tool-call renders (`● Name(…)` headers and
  their `⎿`/indented children) are now masked out of the built-in limit, overload, and
  safeguard matching. TUI path only: print mode still scans quoted/JSON error shapes,
  a live banner rendered as a `└` child of an agent-finished notice is still detected,
  and `customPatterns` keep their scan-everything semantics (#63).
- **Orphaned shell wrapper no longer breaks `claude`.** Removing the package with
  `npm uninstall -g` (without running `claude-auto-retry uninstall` first) left the
  rc-file wrapper pointing at a deleted `launcher.js`, so every `claude` invocation
  died with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. The wrapper now falls back to `command claude` when
  the launcher no longer exists. Existing installs pick this up on the next
  `claude-auto-retry install` (re-run it once after updating) (#65).
- **Timezone off-by-a-day in reset-time waits.** A reset timezone beyond UTC±12
  (e.g. `Pacific/Auckland` in summer, UTC+13) — or a host whose offset differs from the
  banner's by more than 12h — made the wait land on the wrong day (~24h too long:
  "resets 11:40pm" seen at 10pm waited 25.7h instead of 1.7h). The convergence
  correction is now anchored to the target date, not a minimum-magnitude ±12h
  adjustment, and the initial guess parses in host-local time (#60).
- After the in-tmux session's own process exits, the pane now falls through to the
  user's login shell (`$SHELL`, bash fallback) instead of a hardcoded `bash` (#54).
- `reconcile` claude detection follow-ups (#49 review): (1) node flags that take a
  separate-token value (`-r`/`--require`, `--import`, `--loader`, `-e`) are skipped when
  finding the executed script, so a preload-instrumented `node -r x …/claude` is detected
  and a `node -r /opt/claude server.js` no longer false-matches; (2) a launcher wrapping a
  print-mode session (`node …/wrap claude -p`) is skipped — print mode is now read from the
  args after the `claude` subcommand token, not the wrapper's first positional; (3) a
  launcher child is verified claude-shaped before arming, instead of trusting that the
  launcher only ever spawns claude.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- `CLAUDE_KEEP_GOING_LAUNCH_WRAPPER` env var: a prefix command prepended to each interactive
  session (e.g. `caffeinate -i` to keep macOS awake while Claude works). Generic and opt-in —
  unset spawns `claude` directly, unchanged (#47).
- **Chrome-aware detection.** Limit/overload/menu detectors now skip trailing UI
  furniture (input box, footer, key hints, todo/task widget, status spinner,
  `/usage-credits` hint) before reading the live tail, so a genuine banner behind a tall
  task widget is still detected (fixes a ~54-min stall) while a banner merely quoted in
  scrollback is not (#34).
- **`reconcile` / `install-timer` / `exclude-self`** for self-healing monitor coverage: a
  monitor killed (or a `claude` started outside the wrapper) is re-armed from live tmux +
  process state, on demand or via a `systemd --user` timer (#32).
- **macOS support for `reconcile` / `install-timer`**: the running-monitor probe now uses
  `pgrep -lf` on Darwin (BSD pgrep prints full args with `-l`, not procps' `-a`, so
  reconcile previously always aborted with "cannot verify coverage" on macOS), claude
  detection falls back to the basename of argv[0] from ps `args=` (macOS `comm=` prints
  the executable's full path truncated to 16 chars — never "claude" — so the strict
  compare saw zero claude sessions), and
  `install-timer` installs a launchd LaunchAgent
  (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claude-auto-retry.reconcile.plist`, `RunAtLoad` +
  `StartInterval` 300s, `AbandonProcessGroup` so the freshly-armed detached monitors
  survive the short-lived job, and an explicit `PATH` covering both Homebrew prefixes —
  launchd does not inherit the login shell's PATH, so `spawn tmux` would otherwise
  ENOENT) instead of requiring systemd. The reconcile lock's `ps -o lstart=` start token
  is now pinned to `LC_ALL=C` so the timer (C locale) and an interactive shell (user
  locale) always agree on lock-holder identity.
- Safeguard/AUP false-positive auto-retry: when the model's safeguards flag a
  message ("safeguards flagged this message"), re-send a short retry up to
  `safeguard.maxRetries` times, then give up loudly once. Detection is anchored
  to the `API Error` render (mentioning the phrases in conversation can't
  trigger it), and the retry budget is kept across working ticks so a sticky
  flag stays bounded (#33).
- tmux status bar indicator: the monitor now writes a per-pane status snapshot to
  `~/.claude-auto-retry/status/<pane>.json` on every poll tick, and a new
  `claude-auto-retry-tmux-status` script renders it as a status-bar segment
  (`🟢AR` monitoring, `⏳AR 1h30m` waiting on a reset, `🟠AR 45s` overload backoff,
  `🔴AR` gave up). Dependency-free POSIX shell; hides itself if a pane has no
  monitor or its status file is stale (staleness is derived from the monitor's
  actual poll interval, not a fixed constant).

### Fixed
- Rate-limit banner detection now captures a taller pane (120 lines, was 50): a session-limit
  banner pushed far up by a big task widget + input box + footer (~90 lines seen in the wild)
  was beyond the capture window entirely and never detected, leaving the session idle past its
  reset. The chrome-aware tail still strips furniture and a stale banner with real output below
  it stays out, so the wider capture doesn't add false positives (#38).
- `reconcile` now also re-arms claude sessions whose process command isn't `claude`
  (Finding 6): a claude CLI run under `node` with its process.title unset (shows comm
  `node`), and a session our own launcher wraps in an agent harness that embeds claude
  (e.g. `happier claude`) — both were invisible to the `comm === 'claude'` match, so the
  self-healing timer never re-armed them once their monitor died. Detection stays
  conservative: only a node process that IS the claude CLI (script basename `claude` or
  the `claude-code` cli entry) or a pane our `launcher.js` wraps — never a bare node
  process. `exclude-self` recognizes these sessions too.
- Overload scraper stays a live safety net once the StopFailure hook is active. It was
  disabled permanently the first time any `overloaded`/`server_error` event latched, so a
  transient API 429 the event path can't emit (`API Error: Server is temporarily limiting
  requests …`) went undetected and the session sat stuck until resumed by hand. The
  anchored overload patterns can't misfire on a session/usage limit (no `API Error` line).
  The scraper also skips the exact banner the event path just retried until it clears or
  changes, so a render lingering after an edge-triggered retry can't open a second backoff
  (a double injection that would also reset the give-up budget).
- Monitor no longer stays parked on a stale wait timer once the session resumes:
  while counting down a usage wait, a pane that has resumed working (e.g. the user
  manually typed `continue` to unstick a wrong/stale wait) now drops back to
  monitoring immediately, so a second, genuine limit that follows is detected
  instead of being masked until the old timer expires (#39).
- The `/usage-credits` backstop no longer reopens the scrollback false positive: it only
  fires when the companion sits in the live region (nothing but chrome below it), so a
  resumed session's stale banner+companion can't drive spurious retries or a ~24h wait (#34).
- `isWorking` is chrome-aware, matching `isRateLimited`: a live "esc to interrupt" footer
  pushed up by a chrome stack is no longer missed, so retry text can't land in a
  mid-flight session (#34).
- The `/rate-limit-options` menu detectors are chrome-aware too, so a live menu behind a
  widget is driven to "Stop and wait" instead of skipped (which risked confirming
  "Upgrade your plan") (#34).
- Overload detection is bounded to a max raw distance from the prompt, so the deeper
  50-line capture can't reach an old quoted `API Error` buried behind a tall widget (#34).
- Chrome classifiers are anchored to real footer/widget renders (pipe-anchored version,
  indented task items, `⏵⏵` mode footer), so ordinary content — `Press ctrl+c…`, a
  `→` rename, a flush-left `✓ …` summary, `Released v0.5.1` — is no longer stripped (#34).
- `install-timer` no longer crashes on npm installs — `systemd/` is shipped in the package
  and the template reads fail with a clear message instead of ENOENT (#32).
- `reconcile` distinguishes a real `pgrep` failure (ENOENT, busybox without `-a`, macOS
  PID-only output) from "no monitors running", and aborts loudly rather than arming a
  duplicate monitor per pane every run (#32).
- Monitor coverage is keyed per-pane, so a stopped `claude` keeping its monitor can't lead
  to a second monitor on the same pane (#32).
- A single-instance lock (pid + start-token identity) stops an overlapping manual + timer
  run from double-spawning, and can't wedge on PID reuse (#32).
- Exclude-file PID entries are pruned when dead, so kernel PID reuse can't permanently mute
  a future session (the self-expiring behavior the docs promised) (#32).
- Print-mode panes (`claude -p` / `--print`) are no longer given a send-keys monitor (#32).
- The generated systemd unit quotes the node/CLI paths (spaces no longer break it), drops
  the no-op `Persistent=true`, and `install-timer` prints an nvm re-run caveat (#32).
- `rate_limit` StopFailure events are no longer routed through the seconds-scale
  overload path — a session/usage limit is an hours-scale wait owned by the
  usage path, and the misroute made the two fight (futile `Continue` retries
  into a session-limited pane). The marker error type is validated at the
  consumer too, so an outdated installed hook can't reintroduce it (#31).

### Changed
- `customPatterns` are matched against the raw last-N lines (unchanged from pre-#34
  semantics), not the chrome-skipped view — the user owns their own tradeoff (#34).
- Removed the dead `CLAUDE_COMMANDS` constant (#32). Reconcile's session detection was
  since extended beyond `comm === 'claude'` to also cover node-launched and launcher-wrapped
  claude — see the Finding 6 entry under Fixed.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-30

**Upgrade if you installed `0.5.0` from npm.** The `0.5.0` npm artifact was built
before #29 was merged and shipped without the usage-retry anti-spam fix. `0.5.1`
includes it. (The git tag `v0.5.0` already contained #29; only the npm tarball was
behind.)

### Fixed
- Stop the usage-retry path from spamming an already-resumed session: a lingering
  limit banner in scrollback no longer re-injects `Continue…` every poll. Detection
  is now anchored to the live tail, and an `isWorking` gate stops the moment Claude
  resumes (#29).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-30

This release rolls up everything merged since `0.2.2`, including the API
overload backoff engine and interactive `/rate-limit-options` menu navigation.

### Added
- Detect sustained API overload (`529`/`500`/`503`) and retry with exponential
  backoff, including an event-driven (`StopFailure`) mode (#20, hardened).
- Interactive navigation of the `/rate-limit-options` menu, driving it to
  "Stop and wait" across any menu layout (#19, #26).
- Enable mouse scroll and vi copy-mode in tmux sessions created by the tool (#25).

### Fixed
- Require Claude to be in the foreground before driving the
  `/rate-limit-options` menu, preventing keystrokes from leaking into the wrong
  pane (#28).
- Reliable retry submission plus session/weekly rate-limit detection (#7, #15, #22).
- Correct an off-by-a-day wait when parsing reset times in offset timezones (#6, #23).
- Unalias `claude` before defining the wrapper, fixing a zsh/bash `source` error (#10, #24).
- Skip send-keys correctly when the foreground process is the shell, not Claude (#1).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-31

- Last published baseline release.
